# B31DG-Assignment-2

This assignment builds a real-time machine monitoring system through the utilization of ESP32 microcontroller which is a popular embedded systems platform. The project has two main goals which include developing separate system versions that satisfy a predetermined set of time-sensitive requirements. The first version employs a cyclic executive system followed by a second one which uses FreeRTOS as the real-time operating system.
Each version of the system requires execution of seven functional requirements which include signal production, frequency measurement, LED control, and pushbutton user input processing. The scheduling needs to be exact along with the timing requirements and system design plays an essential role to meet the tight deadlines found in these jobs. A monitoring library evaluates real-time compliance for the examined implementations.
This paper describes the chosen designs together with discussion of responsiveness, modularity, and timing accuracy precision. An analysis is presented of how FreeRTOS mechanisms such as timers, tasks and semaphores improve system maintainability along with flexibility. The research demonstrates embedded systems trade-offs through a comparison between FreeRTOS dynamic scheduling and static scheduling approaches using cyclic executive techniques
